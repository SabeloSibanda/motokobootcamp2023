QUESTION 2

The issue with the code sample is that the variable "counter" is declared as "let" which means it is a constant and cannot be reassigned a new value. The line "counter := counter + 1;" is trying to reassign a new value to the variable and this is not allowed. To fix this issue, you can change the "let" keyword to "var" so the variable can be reassigned new values.


QUESTION 3

The issue with the code sample is the initialization of the variable "message" with an integer value (0) instead of a string. The variable is of type Text and it can only be assigned with a string value. Also, both the functions are marked as query functions, it is not clear what the scope and expected behavior of these functions is. 


QUESTION 4
